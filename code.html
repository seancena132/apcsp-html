    <h2 class="Headings">What it has to offer:</h2>
    <p id="General-Info">
        Our game is probably the best base defense game out there on the market today. Nothing compares to our spectacular graphix or our 3D rendered models and cell block shading that make this game the peak of technological advancement. At a price of only $79.99 plus shipping and handling and tax, this game is also the best deal out there too! You can try the demo version but only after you sign a legal contract in blood that you’ll buy the real game after! :) Don’t like our methods? Well too bad! BUY OUR GAME!
